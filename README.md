# digital_resume

This repository hosts my Digital Resume, which can be found at trentungard.com
The resume exists to display my skills, work, and other important things about me that 
would be useful in my job hunt. 

The website is currently very minimal, but I'm designing an overhaul to it to better display my skills.
I built this one in just under 3 hours. It is kind of messy, but I am cleaning it up.
