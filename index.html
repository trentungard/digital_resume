            <h2>Attention!</h2>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting my website :) I have recently accepted my first position as a full time Web Developer, 
                and have learned quite a bit since I first made this website. It does it's job, but now I would like to
                create something that better reflects just how much I've grown as a Developer and the unique soft skills that I've worked 
                very hard to refine! I'd also like the new site to dig a bit deeper into who I am as a person, and to integrate
                with one of the projects that I have in mind that is targeted at helping decrease the barrier for entry that aspiring Web 
                Developers struggle to overcome. Stay tuned for that and much more, and thanks again for visiting!
            </p>

                        <h5>Position: Freelance Web Developer and Digital Marketer</h5>
                        <p>DLL Digital Media hired me in January of 2020 to work as a Developer and 
                            Digital Marketer. It is in a role as an Independent Contractor, so when I am 
                            assigned clients it is my duty to reach out to them, inform them on the services that 
                            we offer, and then build them a solution. We create mostly ecommerce websites
                            using either Shopify or Woocommerce, creating custom themes for customers that want them.

                        <p>The website for Callahan Lovecchio Law was the first freelance job I have ever done.
                            It also included SEO, Custom Email Setup, Version Control, Logo Design, and even Photography!
                            As far as the website is concerned, I was very satisfied with my ability to make a responsive
                            website inside of what I believed to be a challenging timeline. The design could use work, and if 
                            I could go back there are a lot of things I would have done differently. For that reason, I am currently
                            fully redesigning the website from the ground up, cost free, to establish the quality of work I want to
                            deliver to those that entrust me with something as important as their digital brand identity.

                        <h4>Ungard Digital Development (Coming Soon)</h4>
                        <p>A much more ambitious project that I have full creative control over, for the identity
                            under which I freelance. I also designed the logo myself.  It isn't dont yet, but you can stay up to date with the project on my Github!

                        <h4>This Website :)</h4>
                        <p>When setting our to create this website I wanted to make something clean and minimal, but fully responsive.
                            I wanted to also do it in under 4 hours from absolute start to finish, which in this case is deployment. The only thing
                            that I wasn't able to accomplish was a dark mode, but that is coming soon.

                <h3>So Why Me?</h3>
                <p>I will be the first to admit that I do not have the formal education that 
                    other prospects may have and that is not something that I shy away from mentioning.
                    I am passionate about web development, and have invested as much time into learning as 
                    most of my peers, if not more. The only difference is the setting in which we learned.
                    I am confident in my ability to be a productive member of any team willing to give me a chance.
