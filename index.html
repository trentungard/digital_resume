                        <h4><a href="https://www.callahanlovecchiolaw.com" target="_blank">Callahan Lovechio Law (link)</a></h4>
                        <p>The website for Callahan Lovecchio Law was the first freelance job I have ever done.
                            It also included SEO, Custom Email Setup, Version Control, Logo Design, and even Photography!
                            As far as the website is concerned, I was very satisfied with my ability to make a responsive
                            website inside of what I believed to be a challenging timeline. The design could use work, and if 
                            I could go back there are a lot of things I would have done differently. For that reason, I am currently
                            fully redesigning the website from the ground up, cost free, to establish the quality of work I want to
                            deliver to those that entrust me with something as important as their digital brand identity.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Ungard Digital Development (Coming Soon)</h4>
                        <p>A much more ambitious project that I have full creative control over, for the identity
                            under which I freelance. I also designed the logo myself.  It isn't dont yet, but you can stay up to date with the project on my Github!

                        <h4>This Website :)</h4>
                        <p>When setting our to create this website I wanted to make something clean and minimal, but fully responsive.
                            I wanted to also do it in under 4 hours from absolute start to finish, which in this case is deployment. The only thing
                            that I wasn't able to accomplish was a dark mode, but that is coming soon.

                <h3>So Why Me?</h3>
                <p>I will be the first to admit that I do not have the formal education that 
                    other prospects may have and that is not something that I shy away from mentioning.
                    I am passionate about web development, and have invested as much time into learning as 
                    most of my peers, if not more. The only difference is the setting in which we learned.
                    I am confident in my ability to be a productive member of any team willing to give me a chance.
